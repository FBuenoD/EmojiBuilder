# [EmojiBuilder](https://emoji.debijl.xyz/)

## Summary:

Use Twitter's Open Source SVG emoji to build your own emoji/abominations.

## Roadmap:  

Currently very much in beta, but the follow functionality should be added in short order:
- Save as PNG
- Multiple emoji
- Layer order (reorder z-index of paths)
- Selection of paths
- Deletion of paths

## Contributing:

If you have a stellar idea to implement one of the above functions, go ahead and put in a pull request or issue with your suggestion! I dont really adhere to any particular standard, but try to follow best JS practices and some degree of commenting in your code.
